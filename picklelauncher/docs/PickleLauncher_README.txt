Summary:
  PickleLauncher is meant to a simple frontend for auto-detecting and configuring
  command line based applications that might have different input files, like emulators.

How it works:
  PickleLauncher looks for its configuration from the config.txt and profile.txt.
  profile.txt specifies location, file types, commands, arguments, and entries.
  config.txt contains options for the application gui and input.
